			<p>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)</p><br>
			<p>Released for PC, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii and Nintendo DS</p><br>
			<p>The game series as a whole is highly heterogeneous, since the versions for each platform of each title may have its own gameplay and features.</p><br>
			<p>In 2003, after the second game, Electronic Arts also released a Quidditch-focused game entitled Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup.</p><br>
			<p><b>Cast</b></p><br>
			<p>See List of Harry Potter cast members.</p><br>
			<p><b>LEGO series</b></p><br>
			<p>Four titles of videogames based on LEGO Harry Potter toy series by the famous block-building toy company LEGO have been released. They feature LEGO toy versions of Harry Potter characters, places and items in cartoon-styled, speechless, often comedic animations, typical to LEGO videogames.</p><br>
			<p>Different companies have released these games in two occasions, one at the beggining of the film series and the other near its conclusion.</p><br>
			<p>LEGO Creator (2001-2002)</p><br>
			<p>5152MA3T0YL</p><br>
			<p>LEGO Creator: Harry Potter.</p><br>
			<p>In 2001, Superscape produced a computer game based on LEGO Harry Potter building toy series: LEGO Creator: Harry Potter, which was published by LEGO subsidiary LEGO Media. The game was part of the LEGO Creator video game series.</p><br>
			<p>A sequel based on the second film, entitled LEGO Creator: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was produced by Warner Bros. Interactive in 2002 and also published by LEGO Media.</p><br>
			<p>The two releases received much less attention in comparison to the concurrent Electronic Arts series, thus no more sequels in LEGO Creator Harry Potter series were lately published.</p><br>
			<p>LEGO Harry Potter (2010-2011)</p><br>
			<p>Lego Harry Potter Years 1-4 (Wii cover)</p><br>
			<p>Cover of the Wii version of LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4.</p><br>
			<p>With the film series about to conclude in 2010, LEGO re-acquired rights on the Harry Potter series and, together with its new toy sets, planned the release of a remastered video game based on the Harry Potter series. Traveller's Tales (TT) then produced LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, as part of the LEGO video game series. Focusing on the first four years in the Harry Potter series, the game featured a very detailed and consistent gameplay, in addition to the original soundtrack used in the films.</p><br>
			<p>After the large success and positive reviews acquired by LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, TT produced a sequel focused on the last three years of the series, entitled LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7, which also received good reviews.</p><br>
			<p>The two games were published by Warner Bros. Interactive for most platforms.</p><br>
			<p>Wonderbook series</p><br>
			<p>Wonder book of Spells</p><br>
			<p>Book of Spells game cover.</p><br>
			<p>SCE London Studio, a subsidiary of Sony Computer Entertainment, released a PlayStation-exclusive game called Wonderbook: Book of Spells (or just Book of Spells) in 2012. Directly crediting J. K. Rowling rather than the film series, the game simulates spell learning with a wand, through the Book of Spells by Miranda Goshawk.</p><br>
			<p>A similarily-styled sequel entitled Wonderbook: Book of Potions (or Book of Potions), focused on Zygmunt Budge's Book of Potions, was released in 2013</p><br>
